### Hello, I'm Ryan, a professional business intelligence analyst

Currently I'm working on transitioning into the data industry. I have 12+ years experience in the automobile insurance claims industry and I'm looking to apply that knowledge to help make better business decisions. 

Some facts about me:
- I have been rock climbing for the past 15 years. I hope to continue to push my limits and achieve my personal goal of climbing a V7 outdoors.
- I've just started learning how to bake bread and I'm looking for new ways to improve the quality of my bread.
- My goals for 2024: transition to the data industry and get a job where I can continue to grow.
